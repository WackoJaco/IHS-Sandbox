    <description>If deselected, when a schedule's date range is changed, schedule exceptions that are partly or wholly outside the schedule's date range are deleted. Note: This potentially alters part of the schedule that is still within range. If selected, when a schedule's date range is changed, schedule exceptions that are wholly outside the schedule's date range are deleted. Schedule exceptions that are partly outside the schedule's date range are shortened to fit within the new schedule date range.</description>
